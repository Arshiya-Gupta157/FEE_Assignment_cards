        <h1>Table</h1>
        <p>A table is an item of furniture with a raised flat top and is supported most commonly by 1 to 4 legs
            (although some can have more). It is used as a surface for working at, eating from or on which to place
            things.[1][2] Some common types of tables are the dining room tables, which are used for seated persons to
            eat meals; the coffee table, which is a low table used in living rooms to display items or serve
            refreshments; and the bedside table, which is commonly used to place an alarm clock and a lamp. There are
            also a range of specialized types of tables, such as drafting tables, used for doing architectural drawings,
            and sewing tables.<span id="card-number"></span>.</p>
